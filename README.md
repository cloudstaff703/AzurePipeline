This project demonstrates setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps to build, test, and deploy a Python web application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, the application is containerized using Docker, and continuous integration and continuous deployment processes are managed by Azure DevOps.
